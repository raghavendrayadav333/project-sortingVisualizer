## Project Overview

This project provides an engaging visualization of various sorting algorithms. Array elements are depicted as bars, with distinct colors used to represent different operations:

1. **Light Pink (#FADADD)** - Represents a swap operation.
2. **Soft Blue (#A8D8EA)** - Indicates a comparison between elements.
3. **Mint Green (#B4E1B8)** - Highlights elements that are correctly positioned in the sorted array.

Additionally, the tool tracks and compares the time required by different sorting algorithms to sort the array.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the visual elements.
- **JavaScript (p5.js)**: For interactive and dynamic features.
