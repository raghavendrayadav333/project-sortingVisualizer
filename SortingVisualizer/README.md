-->Project Overview
{
This project offers an interactive visualization of various sorting algorithms. The array elements are represented as bars, with different colors indicating specific operations:

1. **Light Pink (#FADADD)** - Indicates a swap operation.
2. **Soft Blue (#A8D8EA)** - Represents a comparison between elements.
3. **Mint Green (#B4E1B8)** - Shows elements that are correctly placed in the sorted array.

The tool also measures and compares the time taken by different sorting algorithms to sort the array.
